# Gen-AI-Email-Generator

**Gen-AI-Email-Generator** is an AI-powered application designed to help users generate cold emails for job vacancies. The tool utilizes various advanced AI technologies, libraries, and cloud services to streamline the process of generating tailored, professional emails for job applications. By leveraging cutting-edge tools such as LangChain, ChatGroq, ChromaDB, and more, this application offers a fully automated, customizable solution for crafting the perfect cold email.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Cold Emails**: Automatically generates professional, personalized cold emails for job applications.
- **Integration with Llama-3.3-70B Versatile Model**: Uses a highly sophisticated language model to understand the context and generate relevant and engaging email content.
- **Webpage Data Extraction**: Fetches relevant data from job vacancy webpages using LangChainâ€™s `WebBaseLoader` to customize emails with job details.
- **Vector Database with ChromaDB**: Stores and indexes relevant content for easy retrieval to ensure more contextually accurate email generation.
- **Frontend UI via Streamlit**: A user-friendly web interface to interact with the app, generate emails, and modify input parameters as needed.
- **Image Generation for Visual Appeal**: Train an AI model using Jupyter Notebooks to generate email-friendly images (e.g., logos, charts) to accompany the emails.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: A powerful library for creating, managing, and querying language models, integrated with `WebBaseLoader` to fetch data from webpages.
- **ChatGroq (Cloud Platform)**: Leveraged for high-performance AI computations and model deployments, ensuring fast and scalable email generation.
- **ChromaDB**: A vector database to index, store, and retrieve data relevant to email generation, enabling context-aware responses.
- **Llama-3.3-70B Versatile Model**: A large language model (LLM) used to generate intelligent and context-sensitive email content.
- **Streamlit**: A Python library used for building a simple and interactive frontend to allow users to input job details and generate emails.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for training the model on specific tasks, including generating relevant images (e.g., email-friendly visuals).
- **Python Libraries**: Includes libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `requests`, and `beautifulsoup` for data manipulation, web scraping, and AI model integration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Access to the ChatGroq cloud platform (for model deployment)
- A working instance of ChromaDB for vector storage

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gen-ai-email-generator.git
   cd gen-ai-email-generator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```



3.**Configure the cloud platform and database**:
   - Set up your ChatGroq account and configure API access.
   - Set up ChromaDB and ensure it's connected to your application for storing and retrieving vector data.
   - Update configuration settings (e.g., API keys, database URL) in `config.py`.

4.**Run the Streamlit frontend**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5.**Access the app**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser to start generating emails.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: 
   - The frontend (built with Streamlit) allows users to input details such as the job title, company name, and any specific requirements or job description.
   
2. **Data Fetching**:
   - The `WebBaseLoader` from LangChain scrapes job vacancy pages to gather information, which is then used to tailor the email content.
   
3. **Email Generation**:
   - The Llama-3.3-70B Versatile model, hosted on ChatGroq's cloud platform, processes the data and generates a cold email that is relevant and professional.
   
4. **Vector Database**:
   - ChromaDB stores and indexes previously generated email templates, which can be quickly accessed and reused for similar requests, ensuring efficiency and consistency.

5. **Image Generation**:
   - Using the model trained in Jupyter, you can generate email-friendly images such as company logos or other visual content to enhance the email appearance.

6. **Output**:
   - The generated email is displayed on the Streamlit UI for the user to review and modify before sending.
